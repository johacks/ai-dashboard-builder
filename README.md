# AI Dashboard Builder

Drop your data and let the AI make a dashboard and extract insights.

This is currently structured as a simple Plotly app that dinanmically builds a dashboard by analyzing the dataset with LLMs. you can:
- use local LLMs (ollama)
- use external providers by providing your API KEY.

## TODO

- Integrations with other providers (only OpenAI Working ATM),
- better layout for mobile and desktop,
- correct bug in seeing the underlying code of each plot,
- possibility to export dashboard config as a ready to deploy bundle.
- dockerization helpers.
